Welcome to the Subworld Library wiki!

# Getting Started

Before you begin using Subworld Library, it is highly recommended that you download [SubworldLibrary.dll](https://github.com/jjohnsnaill/SubworldLibrary/blob/master/SubworldLibrary.dll), and add it as a dependency to your project, by right-clicking on `Dependencies`, clicking on `Add Reference...`, then `Browse...`, selecting the dll, and clicking `OK`. This will allow you to reference Subworld Library in Visual Studio.
